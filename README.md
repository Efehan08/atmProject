Description: This project is a console-based application simulating the core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It is designed to handle secure user authentication and perform financial transactions using a modular architecture. The system ensures data integrity by validating user inputs and managing account balances dynamically through specific methods.

Key Features:

Secure Authentication Protocol: Features a PIN-based login system with a maximum of 3 attempts. The system automatically blocks access and terminates the session upon repeated failed attempts.

Transaction Management: Users can perform essential banking operations including Balance Inquiry, Cash Deposit, and Cash Withdrawal.

Input Validation: The withdrawal module includes logic to prevent overdrafts by checking if the requested amount exceeds the current balance.

Session Control: The application runs on a continuous loop, allowing users to perform multiple transactions in a single session until they choose to exit.

Technical Skills:

Language: Java

Concepts: Scanner for Input Handling, Modular Methods (void & return types), Control Flow (Switch-Case, If-Else), Loops (While), and Variable Scope Management.
